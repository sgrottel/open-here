The left-side list shows the configured tools.
Those will appear as buttons on the "Open Here" toolbox application window.
The leftmost icon indicates the final placement.

You can use tools with empty "Title" fields as spacer, to configure the placement of other tools.

You can reorder the tools via the arrow buttons or per drag&drop.

Once you select a tool in the list, the right half of this window will show the tool's configuration.
This includes the "Title" the "Icon", and the "Start Configurations".
